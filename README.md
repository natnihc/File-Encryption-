This project implements a secure file encryption and decryption tool using Python and the cryptography library. It provides functionalities to generate a key, save it to a file, and use it for encrypting and decrypting files. The tool prompts the user to input the filename and select either encryption or decryption. It ensures that the encrypted data is stored in a new file with an appropriate suffix and validates the decryption process to handle invalid tokens securely. This tool is designed to protect sensitive information by converting it into an unreadable format and later restoring it to its original state using the correct key.
